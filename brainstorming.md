## 2023-01-16 ~ @theo-armour ~ categories for sources

One day the most engaging anf fun aspect of this project may be the links to the portfolios of projects created by individual developers.

Ultimately there could be hundreds of listings. It might be a good idea to categorize portfolios by discipline.

Given that a target audience is people who are specialist in a particular discipline who would like yo code but are in no way "fullstack developers", a good idea may be to categorize by discipline such as: astronomy, math, music, physics and so on.


## 2023-01-02 ~ @theo-armour ~ guidelines

Three to five owners. Majority rules. Other team members by invite.

As a team member, you are encouraged to add, manage and maintain your own personal folder here - that expresses your unique perspective on JavaScript.

You are encouraged to re-appropriate items from any other repo in any way you want.

plain-javascript.github.io is a landing page. It links to all the repos and informs you why you might like to go there.

You are encouraged to stay on-topic. And the topic is: JavaScript plain and simple. Whatever that means. ;-)

On of the beauties of JavaScript is that coders tend to make good numbers of small demos available on their home pages. A good part of our effort to help you find these treasures and to highlight their good efforts.

JavaScript is not magic. It did not just appear. It is a work-in-progress. You can learn about the history and the future of JavaScript here.

This effort is not MDN, StackOverflow, Reddit or whatever. We have no interest in debugging you code. ;-)

This effort is not a public relations effort, it's more like a phone book. We want to help you get known for what you are good at doing, but we are not here to retweet your press releases.
