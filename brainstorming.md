Three to five owners. Majority rules. Other team members by invite.

As a team member, you are encouraged to add, manage and maintain your own personal folder here - that expresses your unique perspective on JavaScript.

You are encouraged to reappropriate items from any other repo in any way you want.

plain-javascript.github.io is a lanfding page. It links to all the repos and informs you why you might like to go there.

You are encouraged to stay on-topic. And the topic is: JavaScript plain and simple. Whatever that means. ;-)

On of the beauties of JavaScript is that coders tend to make good numbers of small demos available on their home pages. A good part of our effort to help you find these treasures and to highlight their good efforts.

JavaScript is not magic. It did not just appear. It is a work-in-progress. You can learn about the history and the future of JavaScript here.

This effort is not MDN, StackOverflow, Reddit or whatever. We have no interest in debugging you code. ;-)

This effort is not a public relations effort, it's more like a phonebook. We want to help you get known for what you are good at doing, but we are not here to retweet your press releases.
