2023-01-02: As of today we just have the first repository:


## Kitchen Sink: https://plain-JavaScript.github.io/kitchen-sink ~ [![]( https://plain-JavaScript.github.io/assets/octicon.svg)]( https://github.com/plain-JavaScript/kitchen-sink )

A repository of JavaScript resources with more than enough links maintained by @theo-armour

Features I look for with Kitchen Sink efforts include

* Recent activity
* Reasonably extensive body of work
* Source code on GitHub or GitLab
* Link to a demo that just runs
* Even better: Demo that runs on GitHub Pages, jsFiddle, CodePen, StackOverflow or similar
* No need for React, Angular, JQuery
* Node OK - but only if code can also run off a Content Delivery Network (CDN) such as jsDelivr
* Libraries are OK (I heart [Three.js]( https://threejs.org ) ) - just not too many all at once
* A feeling that there is a real personality involved

Features that are not Kitchen Sink-able

* Fullstack developers
* Knowing YAML or TypeScript
