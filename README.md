# https://plain-JavaScript.github.io

This repository provides lists of links to resources for developers of applications based on the JavaScript programming language. The particular emphasis here is on plain "vanilla" scripts that are simple, free and easy on the brain.

***

JavaScript is perhaps the most widely used computer language. Almost any computing task - no matter howe complicated - has been accomplished with JavaScript. Some of the smartest people in the world investigate the most difficult issues using JavaScript.

So where does that leave us simple folk?

The good news:

The fastest, easiest and simplest way to get stuff on the Internet is: JavaScript

If you can type the following into a text file and drag that file into a browser, you may call yourself a programmer

``` JavaScript
<script>
    document.write("Hello, World!")
</script>
```

This repository is dedicated to helping us [KISS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle ) people play with JavaScript in simple, fun useful ways.

It wants to show that JavaScript covers a huge range of possibilities while at the same time demonstrating that much can be accomplished with tiny amounts of code.

2022-12-18 ~ This is my second day on this project. It is a work-in-progress. My goal is to spend an hour or so a day in this effort - until such time I feel that the effort is worth sharing. ❧ Theo Armour

## Reference ~ Wikimedia Foundation projects relating to JavaScript

### Wikipedia ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript

>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

Wikipedia is a good place to start because it provides overviews including the vocabulary you may encounter, the history of the effort and links to the range of available resources.

The Categories section at the bottom of the article opens up to display an extensive array of resources.


### Wikibooks: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript

>The Wikibook on hand is intended as a guide for WEB developers who want to learn the basics of the programming language JavaScript. It offers short descriptions of concepts, syntax, context, and JavaScript-related technologies, as well as code examples and exercises. Additional links lead the reader to in-depth information regarding the more complex features and such issues that have a loose relation to JavaScript. Especially the Wikiversity course "JavaScript Programming" offers a rich set of additional details and links to YouTube learning videos.

The JavaScript Wikibook provides a detailed overview of the language. It's more of a reference manual people with some JavaScript experience than a learning resources for beginners. As with many Wiki efforts, it's great in some places and lacking in others. Perhapd the biggest issue is that it is no always up to date with features in the latest releases. For example, https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript/Arrays#Properties_and_methods leaves out many options. Perhaps, the greatest strengths are the extensive lists of links to relevant resources.


### Wikiversity: https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/JavaScript_Programming

>This course comprises 16 lessons on JavaScript programming. Each lesson includes a combination of Wikipedia and Internet-based readings, YouTube videos, and hands-on learning activities. The entire course can be downloaded in book form by selecting "Download Learning Guide" in the sidebar.

The material in the Wikiversity JavaScript course appear to be a great resource for helping teachers prepare college and advanced highschool level courses.

## Reference ~ Technical Standards

JavaScript is a language with a free and open source specification. The specification of JavaScript is an [International Standard]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standard ) and is maintained by ecma-international.org. It is ISO/IEC 16262.

It is worth noting that only a few computer languages are maintained as technical standards. These include C, C++, COBOL, Fortran and Ruby. Note that PHP, Python, Perl, Swift and Rust are privately maintained.

### https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/

* https://www.ecma-international.org/technical-committees/tc39/


### https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/script

>While the most common scripting language ECMAscript (more widely known as JavaScript) is developed by Ecma, a great many of the APIs made available in browsers have been defined at W3C.

Standards maintained by W3 include: Audio, Canvas, CORS, DOM, DOM events, EME File, Geolocation, IndexedDB, MSE, SSE, SVG, Video, WebAssembly, WebAuthn, WebGPU, WebRTC, WebSocket, WebXR, Web messaging, Web storage, Web worker, and XMLHttpRequest


### https://www.khronos.org/

>Khronos royalty-free open standards for 3D graphics, Virtual and Augmented Reality, Parallel Computing, Machine Learning, and Vision Processing. Khronos develops and maintains WebGL ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL and WebCL.

W3 and Khronos are two organizations developing and maintaining standards use to generate libraries of software that are embedded in browsers and readily available to you as a JavaScript programmer.

Future editions may list more standards bodies that help regulate JavaScript features.

### Jérôme Beau: Design: #noFramework ~ https://javarome.medium.com/design-noframework-bbc00a02d9b3

* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30568699

>In the end, frameworks look like religions (or politics): each of them pretend to have the solution, but each of them is different. Each of them claim to provide the best vision of ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶w̶o̶r̶l̶d̶ an app, but there are heated debates about which one holds the truth. Each of them requires you to follow specific rules and, while there may be similarities, it is always hard to convert from one to another.

>Let’s look at an “atheist” approach of frameworks: use none.

### Jeremy Likness: Build a Single Page Application (SPA) Site With Vanilla.js ~ https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/build-a-spa-site-with-vanillajs/
>Modern JavaScript frameworks exist to address deficiencies in the capabilities provided out of the box by HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, and WebAssembly. The latest stable version of JavaScript (ECMAScript® 2015) evolved significantly compared to earlier versions, with better control over scope, powerful string manipulation capabilities, destructuring, parameter enhancements, and the built-in implementation of classes and modules (there is no longer a need to use IIFEs or immediately-invoked function expressions). The purpose of this post is to explore how to build modern apps using the latest JavaScript features.

### https://github.com/frameworkless-movement/

>The Frameworkless Movement is a group of developers interested in developing applications without frameworks. We don't hate frameworks, nor we will ever create campaigns against frameworks, but we perceive the misuse of frameworks as a lack of knowledge regarding technical debt and the availability of alternatives given by the vanilla language or by dedicated libraries.

>The demoscene is an international computer art subculture focused on producing demos: self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that produce audiovisual presentations. The purpose of a demo is to show off programming, visual art, and musical skills. Demos and other demoscene productions (graphics, music, videos, games) are shared at festivals known as demoparties, voted on by those who attend and released online.

>Summary: I believe that small websites are compelling aesthetically, but are also important to help us resist selling our souls to large tech companies. In this essay I present a vision for the “small web” as well as the small software and architectures that power it. Also, a bonus rant about microservices.
