# Plain JavaScript

_Awesome list of curated links to the many wonderful aspects of simple, fast and future-proof JavaScript_


## Links to here: https://plain-JavaScript.github.io ~ [![]( https://plain-JavaScript.github.io/assets/octicon.svg)]( https://github.com/plain-JavaScript/plain-JavaScript.github.io )

This home page links to repositories with useful JavaScript resources.

See [brainstorming.md]( https://github.com/plain-JavaScript/plain-javascript.github.io/blob/main/brainstorming.md ) for details.

2023-01-14 ~ We now have two repos of curated links and comments for you to check out!

See also the [Discussions]( https://github.com/plain-JavaScript/plain-javascript.github.io/discussions ) page for more on the new repo.


## #noframework: https://plain-JavaScript.github.io/noframework ~ [![]( https://plain-JavaScript.github.io/assets/octicon.svg)]( https://github.com/plain-JavaScript/noframework )

#noframework is a repository maintained by [@javarome]( https://github.com/Javarome )

"#noframework" is also a great hashtag. It encompasses and even greater arena of effort than "plain JavaScript". For example, see https://www.frameworklessmovement.org/

Javarome's repo is the place to start to get an overview of what this project is about. Even of greater significance, you can begin to get an idea why this project may be significant, useful and fun.


## Kitchen Sink: https://plain-JavaScript.github.io/kitchen-sink ~ [![]( https://plain-JavaScript.github.io/assets/
octicon.svg)]( https://github.com/plain-JavaScript/kitchen-sink )

A repository of JavaScript resources with more than enough links maintained by @theo-armour

Features I look for with Kitchen Sink efforts include

* Recent activity
* Reasonably extensive body of work
* Source code on GitHub or GitLab
* Link to a demo that just runs
* Even better: Demo that runs on GitHub Pages, jsFiddle, CodePen, StackOverflow or similar
* No need for React, Angular, JQuery
* Node OK - but only if code can also run off a Content Delivery Network (CDN) such as jsDelivr
* Libraries are OK (I heart [Three.js]( https://threejs.org ) ) - just not too many all at once
* A feeling that there is a real personality involved

Features that are not Kitchen Sink-able

* Fullstack developers
* Knowing YAML or TypeScript
