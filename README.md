This repository lists resources for developers of plain vanilla JavaScript.

JavaScript is perhaps the most widely used computer language. Almost any computing task - no matter howe complicated - has been accomplished with JavaScript. Some of the smartest people in the world investigate the most difficult issues using JavaScript.

So where does that leave us simple folk?

The good news:

The fastest, easiest and simplest way to get stuff on the Internet is: JavaScript

If you can type the following into a text file and drag that file into a browser, you may call yourself a programmer

``` JavaScript
<script>
    document.write("Hello, World!")
</script>
```

This repository is dedicated to helping us [KISS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle ) people play with JavaScript in simple, fun useful ways.

It wants to show that JavaScript covers a huge range of possibilities while at the same time demonstrating that much can be accomplished with tiny amounts of code.

2022-12-18 ~ This is my second day on this project. It is a work-in-progress. My goal is to spend an hour or so a day in this effort - until such time I feel that the effort is worth sharing. ❧ Theo Armour

### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript

>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.


### https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript

>The Wikibook on hand is intended as a guide for WEB developers who want to learn the basics of the programming language JavaScript. It offers short descriptions of concepts, syntax, context, and JavaScript-related technologies, as well as code examples and exercises. Additional links lead the reader to in-depth information regarding the more complex features and such issues that have a loose relation to JavaScript. Especially the Wikiversity course JavaScript Programming offers a rich set of additional details and links to YouTube learning videos.

### Jérôme Beau: Design: #noFramework ~ https://javarome.medium.com/design-noframework-bbc00a02d9b3

>In the end, frameworks look like religions (or politics): each of them pretend to have the solution, but each of them is different. Each of them claim to provide the best vision of ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶w̶o̶r̶l̶d̶ an app, but there are heated debates about which one holds the truth. Each of them requires you to follow specific rules and, while there may be similarities, it is always hard to convert from one to another.

>Let’s look at an “atheist” approach of frameworks: use none.

### Jeremy Likness: Build a Single Page Application (SPA) Site With Vanilla.js ~ https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/build-a-spa-site-with-vanillajs/
>Modern JavaScript frameworks exist to address deficiencies in the capabilities provided out of the box by HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, and WebAssembly. The latest stable version of JavaScript (ECMAScript® 2015) evolved significantly compared to earlier versions, with better control over scope, powerful string manipulation capabilities, destructuring, parameter enhancements, and the built-in implementation of classes and modules (there is no longer a need to use IIFEs or immediately-invoked function expressions). The purpose of this post is to explore how to build modern apps using the latest JavaScript features.

>If you're developing a library on the other hand, please take a moment to consider if you actually need jQuery as a dependency. Maybe you can include a few lines of utility code, and forgo the requirement. If you're only targeting more modern browsers, you might not need anything more than what the browser ships with.

## Small Web

### https://github.com/frameworkless-movement/

>The Frameworkless Movement is a group of developers interested in developing applications without frameworks. We don't hate frameworks, nor we will ever create campaigns against frameworks, but we perceive the misuse of frameworks as a lack of knowledge regarding technical debt and the availability of alternatives given by the vanilla language or by dedicated libraries.

>The demoscene is an international computer art subculture focused on producing demos: self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that produce audiovisual presentations. The purpose of a demo is to show off programming, visual art, and musical skills. Demos and other demoscene productions (graphics, music, videos, games) are shared at festivals known as demoparties, voted on by those who attend and released online.

>Summary: I believe that small websites are compelling aesthetically, but are also important to help us resist selling our souls to large tech companies. In this essay I present a vision for the “small web” as well as the small software and architectures that power it. Also, a bonus rant about microservices.
