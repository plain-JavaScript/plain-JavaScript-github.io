### Jérôme Beau: Design: #noFramework ~ https://javarome.medium.com/design-noframework-bbc00a02d9b3

>In the end, frameworks look like religions (or politics): each of them pretend to have the solution, but each of them is different. Each of them claim to provide the best vision of ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶w̶o̶r̶l̶d̶ an app, but there are heated debates about which one holds the truth. Each of them requires you to follow specific rules and, while there may be similarities, it is always hard to convert from one to another.

>Let’s look at an “atheist” approach of frameworks: use none.

### Jeremy Likness: Build a Single Page Application (SPA) Site With Vanilla.js ~ https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/build-a-spa-site-with-vanillajs/
>Modern JavaScript frameworks exist to address deficiencies in the capabilities provided out of the box by HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, and WebAssembly. The latest stable version of JavaScript (ECMAScript® 2015) evolved significantly compared to earlier versions, with better control over scope, powerful string manipulation capabilities, destructuring, parameter enhancements, and the built-in implementation of classes and modules (there is no longer a need to use IIFEs or immediately-invoked function expressions). The purpose of this post is to explore how to build modern apps using the latest JavaScript features.

>If you're developing a library on the other hand, please take a moment to consider if you actually need jQuery as a dependency. Maybe you can include a few lines of utility code, and forgo the requirement. If you're only targeting more modern browsers, you might not need anything more than what the browser ships with.


## Small Web

### https://github.com/frameworkless-movement/

>The Frameworkless Movement is a group of developers interested in developing applications without frameworks. We don't hate frameworks, nor we will ever create campaigns against frameworks, but we perceive the misuse of frameworks as a lack of knowledge regarding technical debt and the availability of alternatives given by the vanilla language or by dedicated libraries.

### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene ~ Demoscene

>The demoscene is an international computer art subculture focused on producing demos: self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that produce audiovisual presentations. The purpose of a demo is to show off programming, visual art, and musical skills. Demos and other demoscene productions (graphics, music, videos, games) are shared at festivals known as demoparties, voted on by those who attend and released online.

### https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/ ~ Ben Hoyt: The small web is beautiful

* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26305585

>Summary: I believe that small websites are compelling aesthetically, but are also important to help us resist selling our souls to large tech companies. In this essay I present a vision for the “small web” as well as the small software and architectures that power it. Also, a bonus rant about microservices.
