Where do you draw the line between JavaScript and plain JavaScript?

Time will tell. Observations will be made. Guidelines and rules will be created. Content will be updated and amended.

Until then, it's complicated.

Some thoughts:
* I'd rather start with being more inclusive then less. [There is Wikipedia concept arounf this. Whart is its name.]
* In whatever topic being addressed where there is significant "fully-leaded" JavaScriptcontent, it will be nice to provide links to relevant "awesome lists" on that topic
* If for some reason, a link is dropped from a topic because it is no longer seen as relevant, then I hope it may still appear in an archive somewhere - with a not indicating the reason why the link was demoted. Knowing why something is deleted may be as important as to why it was added.

This is my second day on this project. It is a work-in-progress. My goal is to spend an hour or so a day in this effort - until such time I feel that the effort is worth sharing. ‚ùß Theo Armour
